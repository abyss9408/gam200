Bass'N'Kick – 2D Narrative Rhythm Game
GAM200/250 Software Engineering Project | Team of 8 | Role: Technical Lead

Developed a Muse Dash–inspired rhythm game using a custom-built game engine created from scratch. As Technical Lead, I contributed by:
- Implementing a custom Entity Component System (ECS) to organize game objects efficiently.
- Designing a scalable serializer/deserializer to support major game systems.
- Setting up the level editor, including inspector, scene/game viewports, and entity hierarchy.
- Building core systems: parent-child hierarchy, prefab manager (nested & non-nested), and prefab sync across scenes.
- Creating a layer manager for collision detection and rendering order.
- Providing regular support to teammates, including bug fixing and mentoring less experienced programmers.
